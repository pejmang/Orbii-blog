pillar: "culture"
title: "Culture"
description: "A powerful sense of belonging rooted in a strong entrepreneurial culture. The culture of a high-performance organization is the foundation upon which the entire structure rests. This culture embodies innovation, agility, and resilience. It creates cohesion around a shared mission and aligns the behavior of each member toward a common vision. Failure is seen as a natural step in the learning and progress process. In the age of AI, this culture becomes even more crucial, as it must encourage openness to change, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to quickly integrate new technologies, especially those related to artificial intelligence."
