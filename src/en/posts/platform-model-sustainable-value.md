Globalization, the merge of digital services, the explosion of data, and the need for **ATAWAD** mobility connection (which refers to the technological capability provided to users to access information *anytime, anywhere, on any device). GAMA and BATX have understood that the fusion of tech, data and mobility will open up the possibilities for them thanks to platforms.

### **New competition in an open and innovative world**

For many years, we have been witnessing the **emergence of new business models** like big tech, which are transforming many industries with new rules. **GAFA**, **NATU**, and **BATX** are reshaping the landscape with **AI**, **machine learning**, **blockchain**, and are driving drastically new business models. All these changes require a rethinking of B-To-B and B-To-C relationships around what we now call **Platforms**.

The **platform economy** is a current and future trend. It offers challenges and opportunities for enterprises, industries, markets, and public organizations, but also for society, customers, and daily lives. **Platforms** are hybrid players between companies and markets, driven by **technological innovations**, **online connectivity**, and **data**.

The success of platforms now seems **exponential**, and their growth **unlimited**. Companies like **Amazon**, **Uber**, and **Airbnb** are disrupting entire sectors (retail, urban mobility, hotels, and restaurants) and competing with or even outgrowing historical leaders.

### **What is Platformization and a Platform?**

**Platformization** is a phenomenon where organizations evolve their structures to adapt, change, and pursue their missions in a dynamic context. A **platform** is a business model that leverages **technology** and enables companies to offer new services and interact more effectively with employees, customers, suppliers, and the broader economic ecosystem.

Platforms are not just integrated suites of software products but holistic **business models** that create value by connecting consumers and producers. They leverage **network effects** to drive transactions, and some even use **physical assets** as control points to increase usage and foster developer ecosystems.

### **Key Elements of a Successful Platform**

To build a successful platform, several key elements are necessary:
- **Network effect**: When new users increase the value and usefulness of a product or service. For example, the more users a social media platform has, the more valuable it becomes for communication.
- **User experience (UX)**: A successful UX creates strong relationships between the brand and users, focusing on customer needs and building **long-term ties**.
- **Data**: Data is the fuel of platforms. It allows for personalized, optimized services, and **data analytics** enables better decision-making and **recommendations**.
- **Technology**: The technological backbone of a platform ensures **connections**, cross-services, and enables scalability. Using cloud technologies and agile delivery practices, platforms can integrate and evolve with **market trends**.

### **Platforms Driving Digital Transformation**

Platforms are a response to digital transformation. Companies like **Alibaba**, **Ping An**, or **Airbnb** have successfully utilized platforms to partner with companies in complementary sectors. Digital platforms **redefine customer relationships**, emphasizing **customer experience**, products, and services. **Technology** makes it possible to offer these services, collect data, and better exploit it to innovate and personalize services.

In the **digital platform ecosystem**, technology mediates connections between actors (people, organizations, resources), making it easy for participants to **exchange value**. **Steve Jobs** once said, “Technology alone is not enough,” highlighting the importance of **openness**, innovation, and collaboration.

Platforms allow companies to **bolt on products and services**, access new markets, and grow top-line revenues by understanding customer demands and collaborating with the **ecosystem**.
