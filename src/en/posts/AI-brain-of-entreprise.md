In the bustling world of digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) and data management have emerged as the essential foundations of modern enterprises. These two drivers now constitute the "brain" that propels organizational performance, influences decision-making, and optimizes operations. In this article, we will explore how the "Data & AI" pillar is essential in digital transformation while incorporating insights from recent academic research. This will allow us to demonstrate how science fuels business practices and opens up innovative horizons.

### AI and Data: The Inseparable Duo of the Digital Era

Artificial intelligence and data play a central role in creating new organizational dynamics. Academic studies, notably those by Davenport and Ronanki (2018), show that AI is no longer limited to isolated tasks but now acts as a central innovation engine by leveraging capabilities in natural language processing, computer vision, and deep neural networks.

Researchers emphasize the importance of data collection and governance in effectively powering these AI systems. The concept of "data-centric AI," introduced in several recent PhD studies, suggests that the quality of data is more critical than the complexity of the algorithms themselves. For instance, a thesis conducted on...

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital transformation, AI and data management are the cornerstones that ensure the longevity and competitiveness of companies. Far from being isolated technological tools, they form the strategic brain that enables organizations to innovate, optimize their operations, and protect their critical assets. To thrive in this dynamic digital environment, businesses must integrate the "Data & AI" pillar into all their activities. By adopting a holistic approach, where interconnected technologies enhance decision-making and operational capabilities, they can not only survive but also prosper in the era of artificial intelligence.
