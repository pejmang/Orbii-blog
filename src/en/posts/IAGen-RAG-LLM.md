In the ever-evolving landscape of AI and Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, or Mistral’s models, automated content generation is garnering strong interest from businesses. Although effective in rephrasing text or handling creative tasks, these traditional LLMs have **major limitations for adoption in a professional context** (whether client-facing or for internal use). Their disconnection from the real-world business environment makes them prone to **hallucinations**, meaning they generate false or erroneous information, often with the confidence of a seasoned consultant.

But this is no surprise: LLMs are asked to generate text, so they perform the task as requested.

The problem lies in the fact that their training was done on **public data**, not on **specific business knowledge**. To address these intrinsic weaknesses, a new term has emerged, one you have likely already heard in meetings with your AI experts and consultants: **RAG**, or *Retrieval-Augmented Generation*. RAG has become a key tool in your Data architecture, enabling the full potential of LLMs to be harnessed.

## How RAG Works Technically

To simplify it (apologies to purists), **RAG** starts with an exhaustive search for specialized information, then generates an appropriate response to a question. RAG helps anchor LLM responses in **verified and contextualized data**. It’s a two-phase process:

1. **Retrieval of relevant data**: Lexical indexing, text vectorization, and named entity recognition are techniques used to improve search accuracy. The goal is to retrieve all the useful and relevant information to answer the user's query.
2. **Generation of a response based on the "augmented" context**: The language model generates an appropriate response to the question based on the results of this specialized search.

## Concrete Advantages Across Various Sectors

The benefits of RAG are already evident for pioneering companies:

- **Banking sector**: At an American bank, analysts produce risk reports more quickly and with a much lower error rate than those generated by traditional LLMs.
- **Healthcare**: RAG has enabled the generation of more accurate personalized medical summaries.
- **Automotive industry**: RAG is used to write user guides that integrate both technical data and customer feedback.

## Investments and Regulatory Considerations

Despite its potential, **RAG represents a significant investment**: resources in technology, data engineering, software engineering, and data science are required for data collection/structuring, training, and integration into information systems via APIs.

From a regulatory standpoint, **data confidentiality** is paramount. Well-designed architectures are crucial to leveraging the power of the Cloud while protecting sensitive information. **Transparency in AI processes** and **traceability of algorithmic decisions** must also be ensured to prevent discriminatory biases.

Strong **governance** is necessary to conduct frequent audits and checks, ensuring compliance with industry and company regulations (data protection and AI ethics).

## Appendices: Additional Elements

### Reliability and Continuous Adaptation of RAG Models

RAG fundamentally relies on the company's **knowledge base**. A knowledge management strategy is therefore essential to ensure this base is up-to-date and reliable.

### Integration of RAG into Existing Information Systems

Integrating RAG into existing information systems is a crucial challenge for facilitating its adoption and use by employees. **APIs and dedicated connectors** can be developed to ensure smooth communication between different platforms and RAG models, essentially under the umbrella of **AI-Ops**.

### Evaluation and Performance Monitoring

To measure the impact and benefits of LLMs within the company, it is important to establish **appropriate performance metrics and indicators**. These metrics may include accuracy, relevance, speed, and user satisfaction. Regular performance tracking will help identify areas for improvement and optimize models accordingly.

### Employee Awareness, Acculturation, and Training

Adoption of these technologies depends on **employees**, thus requiring appropriate awareness and training. Customized workshops and training sessions can be offered to familiarize users with the functionalities and benefits of these AI solutions, as well as best practices in terms of ethics and data protection.

### Collaboration with Industry Stakeholders and Regulators

One of the most important steps to initiate (not only at the institutional level) is **collaboration** with other industry stakeholders and regulators. Partnerships and expertise exchanges can help develop **common standards and best practices**, including on the topic of Open Source, with the goal of creating a **favorable ecosystem for responsible innovation and growth**.
