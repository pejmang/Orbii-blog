I had the pleasure of publishing my first book, _The New Horizon of Digital Transformation: The 9 Pillars for Developing a Data-Driven Strategy_, in February 2022, with:

**Jean Barrère, Nouamane Cherkaoui**

Over the past two years (2022 – 2024), during our interactions with executives and managers, a recurring theme has emerged: **team exhaustion**. Faced with rapid changes in consumer preferences, technological advancements, environmental challenges, economic fluctuations, and geopolitical disruptions, organizations are forced to constantly reinvent themselves. These disruptions demand continuous adjustments, disturbing established routines and causing fatigue, and in severe cases, marked professional burnout.

**Organizational energy**, crucial to the dynamism and resilience of a company, manifests itself through the ability to mobilize, deploy, and renew resources to achieve its goals and effectively adapt to changing challenges. Optimizing this energy is key, particularly by focusing on two aspects of the nine pillars: _the Maker’s Signature_ and _corporate culture_.

## A) The Maker’s Signature and Understanding Limits

Inspirational leaders, the _Makers_, play a crucial role in modulating organizational energy, with their approaches either revitalizing or depleting human resources. You likely have a Maker in mind who inspired and propelled you forward, and another who pushed you to your limits, but ultimately drained you.

Makers must:

- **Identify individual and team capacities**: Recognizing the thresholds for innovation and change is essential to maintaining a healthy and evolving work environment. This requires establishing continuous feedback systems and regular evaluations to adjust workloads and expectations accordingly.

- **Foster an environment conducive to continuous innovation**: Promote a culture where learning and failure are integrated as essential components of success. This can be achieved by creating spaces dedicated to experimentation and by valuing attempts, whether successful or not, as fundamental to organizational learning.

## B) Cultivating a Positive Corporate Culture

A **strong corporate culture** is directly linked to dynamic organizational energy. To achieve this, leaders must:

- **Promote shared values**: Actively involve employees in defining and embodying organizational values to ensure that these are truly integrated into daily practices.

- **Maintain transparent communication**: Establish formal and informal channels to facilitate open and continuous dialogue, thereby enhancing employee trust and engagement.

- **Implement an effective recognition system**: Develop recognition programs that meet the needs and preferences of employees, combining financial and non-financial rewards to motivate and retain talent.

We have highlighted _the Maker’s Signature_ and _corporate culture_ as key components of managing organizational energy, but it is essential not to overlook the other pillars that also contribute to energizing and supporting change.

And you, **what is your experience and perspective** on this important topic of digital transformation?
